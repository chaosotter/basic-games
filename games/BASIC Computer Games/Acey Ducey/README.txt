Acey Ducey

This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game.  In the game, the
dealer (the computer) deals two cards face up.  You have an option to
bet or not to bet depending on whether or not you feel the next card
dealt will have a value between the first two.

Your initial money (Q) is set to $100.  You may alter statement 110 if
you want to start with more or less than $100.  The game keeps going
until you lose all your money or interrupt the program.

The original program author was Bill Palmby of Prairie View, Illinois.
