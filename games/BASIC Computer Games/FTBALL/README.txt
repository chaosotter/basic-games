FTBALL

Football is probably the most popular simulated sports game.  I have
seen some people elect to play computerized football in preference to
watching a bowl game on television.

Two versions of football are presented.  The first is somewhat more
"traditional" in that you, the player, are playing against the
computer.  You have a choice of seven offensive plays.  On defense the
computer seems to play a zone defense, but you have no choice of
plays.  The computer program presents the necessary rules as you play,
and it is also the referr and determines penalties when an infraction
is committed.  FTBALL was written by John Kemeny at Dartmouth.

In the second version of football, the computer referees a game played
between two human players.  Each player gets a list of twenty plays
with a code value for one.  This list should be kept confidential from
your opponent. The fcodes can be changed in data statements 1770 for
Team 1 and 1780 for Team 2.  All twenty plays are offensive; a
defensive play is specified by defendin against a type of offensive
play.  A defense is good for other similar types of plays, for
example, a defense against a flare pass is very good against a screen
pass but much less good against a half-back option.

This game was originally written by Raymond Miseyka of Butler,
Pennsylvania.
