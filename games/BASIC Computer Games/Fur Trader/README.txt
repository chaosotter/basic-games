Fur Trader

You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 having
the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the next year.  You
have a choice of three forts at which you may trade.  The cost of
supplies and the amount you receive for your furs will depend upon the
fort you choose.  You also specify what types of furs that you have to
trade.

The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer.
