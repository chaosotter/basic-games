Hammurabi

In this game you direct the administrator of Sumeria, Hammurabi, how
to manage the city.  The city initially has 1,000 acres, 100 people,
and 3,000 bushels of grain in storage.

You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for
bushels of grain -- the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels per
acre.  You also must use grain to feed your people and as seed to
plant the next year's crop.

You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only tend a
certain amount of land and that people starve if they are not fed
enough.  You also have the unexpected to contend with such as a
plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable harvests.

You will also find that managing just the few resources in this game
is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years.  The crisis of
population density rears its head very rapidly.

This program was originally written in Focal at DEC; author unknown.
David Ahl converted it to BASIC and added the 10-year performance
accessment.  If you wish to change any of the factors, the extensive
remarks in the program should make modification fairly
straightforward.

Note for trivia buffs: somewhere along the line an m was dropped out
of the spelling of Hammurabi in the Ahl version of the computer
program.  This error has spread far and wide until a generation of
students who have used this program now think that Hammurabi is the
incorrect spelling.
