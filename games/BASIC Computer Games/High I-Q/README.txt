High I-Q

This is a computerized version of an old European solitaire game of
logic.  The game starts with a pegboard shaped like a cross having
pegs in every hole but the center.  The object is to remove all 32
pegs, or as many as possible, by jumping into an empty hole, then
removing the jumped peg.

There are several different winning strategies for playing and, of
course, each strategy can be played eight different ways on the board.
Can you find a consistent winner?
