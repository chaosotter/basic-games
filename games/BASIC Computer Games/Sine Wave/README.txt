Sine Wave

Did you ever go to a computer show and see a bunch of CRT terminals
just sitting there waiting forlornly for someone to give a demo on
them?  It was one of those moments whep I was at DEC that I decided
there should be a little bit of background activity.  And why not plot
with words instead of the usual X's?  Thus SINE WAVE was born and
lives on in dozens of different versions.  At least those CRTs don't
look so lifeless anymore.
