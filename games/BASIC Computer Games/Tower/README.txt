Tower 

This is a simulation of a game of logic that originated in the Middle
East.  It is sometimes called Pharoah's Needles, but its most common
name is the Towers of Hanoi.

Legend has it that a secret society of monks live beneath the city of
Hanoi.  They possess three large towers or needles on which different
size gold disks may be placed.  Moving one at a time and never placing
a larger on a smaller disk, the monks endeavor to move the tower of
disks from the left needle to the right needle.  Legend says when they
have finished moving this 64-disk tower, the world will end.  How many
moves will they have to make to accomplish this?  If they can move 1
disk per minute and work 24 hours per day, how many years will it
take?

In the computer puzzle you are faced with three upright needles.  On
the leftmost needle are placed from two to seven graduated disks, the
largest being on the bottom and smallest on the top.  Your object is
to move the entire stack of disks to the rightmost needle.  However,
you may only move one disk at a time and you may never place a larger
disk on top of a smaller one.

In this computer game, the disks are referred to by their size --
i.e., the smallest is 3, next 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15.  If you play
with fewer than 7 disks always use the largest, i.e. with 2 disks you
would use nos. 13 and 15.  The program instructions are
self-explanatory.  Good luck!

Hague, Netherlands.
