(From Color Computer Magazine, July 1983.)

There will be a large color square on the screen.  The object is to
make the top half blue, the bottom half orange.  The program
recognizes a winning situation.  As the program begins, the winning
state is shown, then the two colors exchange.  After that there is a
series of exchanges of parts between the two blocks.  This results in
a random pattern.  Move the blank cursor over the top half of the
block by tapping the arrow keys.  Press the space bar and blocks of
colors on top and bottom exchange positions in a pattern.  To solve
the puzzle, you must determine where to place the blank cursor and
press the space bar to make to top blue and the bottom orange.  You
are allowed 50 space bar taps.
