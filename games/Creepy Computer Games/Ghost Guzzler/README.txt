GHOST GUZZLER

The ghosts in this game are numbers rushing across the screen.  To
catch them, you activate your ghost guzzler by pressing key X, but it
only works when the number on It is the same as that of the attacking
ghost.  You can increase the guzzler's number by pressing key M (when
it gets to 9, it goes back to 0 again).  If you fail to guzzle a
ghost, it will snatch away one of your lives (shown as / top left of
the screen).  See how good you are at guzzling ghosts.
