MAD HOUSE

You're trapped in a weird house where everything moves including the
walls.  If the doorways would line up, even for a moment, you could
make a dash for freedom.  You've found a console which appears to
control some of the movements in the house.  Keys X and C make the
doorway nearest to you (top of the screen) change direction.  Keys N
and M have the same effect on the doorway furthest from you.  There
doesn't seem to be any way of controlling the centre doorway.

As you frantically wrestle with the knobs on the console, you can hear
footsteps pounding down the corridor behind you.  The number top left
of the screen shows their progress towards you.  If you can't escape
before the phantom footsteps catch up with you...

...aggghhhhh!
