Fire 

Fire uses the sprite graphics of the Commodore 64 to produce a great
"Invaders" type game.

The alien invader moves across the screen dropping bombs on you.  Each
time he reaches the edge of the screen he drops down to the next level
before coming back the other way.  If one of the bombs hits your fire
base, or if you let the alien craft get down to your level, you will
be blown up and, of course, lose the game.

Use the "J" key and the "K" key to move your fire base left and right
respectively.  The "F" key fires your missiles.

To destroy the alien space craft you must hit it dead centre.  Hitting
the alien ship on the hull will score you points but wonâ€™t blow it up.
Each time you destroy an alien ship it will be replaced by another
one, which will move more quickly across the screen.  Each time you
blow up an alien ship and advance to the next level a new moon will
appear in the sky.  The number of moons indicates the level at which
you are playing.

There is also a feature which gives you the option of playing with a
background of mountains or in the blackness of space.

The program uses a very clever countdown routine to provide a touch of
excitement to the start of the game.

The variables X and Y are used for the screen coordinates of your fire
base and SX and SY are used to move the alien craft.
