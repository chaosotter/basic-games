Space Sketch 

Insert your joystick in port 2.  Before doing the program, type in
this short one.  It will help you to understand the main program by
showing what happens when you push the joystick in different
directions.  Also try the fire button.  Can you find all the numbers
in the diagram?

As you near your destination, you see something awesome.  The camera
is broken.  Sketch what you see.  NASA will want to study your drawing
when you return.

How about drawing diagonally, and in different colors?
